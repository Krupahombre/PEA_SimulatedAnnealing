# Simulated Annealing - Travelling Salesman Problem

This project was made as a task for academic course **Designing Effective Algorithms** at **Wroclaw's University of Science and Technology**.

It's an implementation of Simulated Annealing algorithm solving Travelling Salesman Problem. Program reads all data from **config.ini** file write in specific order all separated by space:
- instance name
- algorithm repetitions for the specific instance
- optimal cost of the specific instance
- vertices change method (i - invert, s - swap)
- cooling method (g - geometrical, l - logarithmic)
- epoch length
- cooling ratio
- start temperature

*Note*: **Data** folder contains some instances ready to use
